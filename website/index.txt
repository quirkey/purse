h1. purse

h2. What

A simple way of storing private/sensitive info and then sharing it with others using git

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install purse</pre>

h2. The basics

Purse stores information in a two level folder system. 
The basic piece of stored information is a *'note'*. 
A *'pocket'* is a folder containing one to many notes.
A *pocket* can be synced between mutlple users/computers using a remote git repository.

h2. Demonstration of usage

To configure for the first time:

<pre>purse</pre>

and follow the handy on screen instructions.

To create a new pocket/note.

<pre>purse pocketname notename</pre>

It will prompt you asking if you want to create the note.

Once you've edited in your favorite editor and saved, purse will use Blowfish to encrypt the note with the password you provide. 

Then you can display the note with:

<pre>purse pocketname notename</pre>

or edit with:

<pre>purse pocketname notename --edit</pre>

Each time it will ask you for the password you initially provided to encrypt it.

For more commands/info run:

<pre>purse --help</pre>
